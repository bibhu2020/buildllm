You don’t update its weights, you just feed your data through it to get features.  \n","   - **Fine-tuning:** Continue training the pre-trained model on your new dataset (sometimes only updating the last few layers) so it adapts to the new task.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Why use Transfer Learning?\n","\n","- **Saves time:** Training a deep neural network from scratch can take days or weeks.  \n","- **Requires less data:** Good performance can be achieved even with a smaller dataset.  \n","- **Improves accuracy:** The model leverages knowledge from the original dataset, improving performance on your task.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## Example in Computer Vision\n","\n","1. Start with **ResNet50** pre-trained on ImageNet.  \n","2. Remove the final classification layer (originally 1000 classes).  \n","3. Add a new layer for your task (e.g., classify 10 types of animals).  \n","4. Fine-tune the model on your smaller dataset.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## Example in PyTorch\n","\n","```python\n","import torchvision.models as models\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","\n","# Load pre-trained ResNet50\n","model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)\n","\n","# Freeze all layers except the final fully connected layer\n","for param in model.parameters():\n","    param.requires_grad = False\n","\n","# Replace the final layer for 10 classes\n","model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 10)\n","```\n","\n","## Summary\n","Transfer learning = reusing a model trained on one task to help with another task.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"qBPPyPfnNycB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## A Demo"],"metadata":{"id":"uaMXS7PfPR1l"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2et6b-tIMKEy"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
